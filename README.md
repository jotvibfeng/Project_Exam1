# Project_Exam1
For this project, I have used all the skills and knowledge I gained during my first year at Noroff. The task was to create a list of blogs with a free choice of topics, so I picked gaming as the focus on sites that interest me.  

# What is the project purpose 
The main reason I made a gaming blog site is to gather a community of people who share a common interest and want to learn about more things in the gaming industry for hobby or career building. I used HTML, CSS, and JS because that is what I have learned so far in my study and I didn`t experiment with new code language rather focused on making the project with the skills I got from the first year. The hardest for me was CSS which has been hard to get right especially not trying to make a scroll bar because of where the item is too far out of the screen but I have learned to use relative rather than absolute. Another thing that made this hard and broken was the js api calling item which sadly made the site broken and ruined I know how it was supposed to look on my live screen in VS but it doesn`t help when it doesn`t work when you deploy it on Netlify but I didn`t notice it the day before delivery I notice that and didn`t have time to change so I got lesser grade then I was expecting.
